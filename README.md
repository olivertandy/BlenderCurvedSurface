# BlenderCurvedSurface
A Blender-Python script to generate a mesh (vertices and edges only) of the curved surface defined by a given function. The curve is defined by the function assigned to the 'transform' variable - the requirement for this function is that it takes a 2D tuplet (u, v) as a single argument and returns a 3D tuplet (x, y, z).
